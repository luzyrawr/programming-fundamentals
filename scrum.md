## Product Backlog
Is an ordered list of everything that is needed in the product like new features, improvements, fixes, etc. The person responsible for the Product Backlog is the **Product Owner.**

* **Inspection:** The process of looking at the backlog and observe its current condition.
* **Adaptation:** When you notice something is wrong, missing or unclear, you go ahead and change that.
* **Refinement:** The process that continuously improves the backlog (clarifying details, answering questions, or adding things that need to be done).
