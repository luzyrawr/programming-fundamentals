# Scrum
## Agile Manifesto

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation.

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.

**Responding to change** over following a plan.

## Scrum Team
1. Scrum Master
2. Product Owner
3. Developers

## Scrum Artifacts
1. Product Backlog -> Product Goal
2. Sprint Backlog -> Sprint Goal
3. Increment -> Definition of Done

## Product Backlog
Is an ordered list of everything that is needed in the product like new features, improvements, fixes, etc. The person responsible for the Product Backlog is the **Product Owner.**

* **Inspection:** The process of looking at the backlog and observe its current condition.
* **Adaptation:** When you notice something is wrong, missing or unclear, you go ahead and change that.
* **Refinement:** The process that continuously improves the backlog (clarifying details, answering questions, or adding things that need to be done).


### Attributes of a Product Backlog Item (PBI)
* Description
* Order
* Size
* Value
* Acceptance criteria

### Product Backlog Refinement
Larger items are broken down into smaller ones.
* Details
* Size
* Order

### User Stories
The User Stories are commonly used to describe a Product Backlog Item. A User Storie is a short descriptions of a feature explained from the perspective of the person who desires the functionality, usually a user of the product.

**Template**

As a "Some user"
I want "Some objective"
So that "some outcome"


* **Estimate** is a guess of the effort necessary to carry out a given task

## Sprint Backlog
Is a list of the selected PBI items for the sprint.

During the Sprint Panning Meeting the Product Owner explains what needs to be done next to increase the value of the product. The Sprint Goal is set by the entire Scrum Team, then the developers will decide which items (top to bottom) can be done in the sprint and will be added to the Sprint Backlog. The persons responsible for the Sprint Backlog are the **Developers**.

Elements of the Sprint Backlog:
1. PBI items for the sprint
2. Sprint Goal
3. Plan

### Increment
Is a new version of the product and is additive to all previous increments from all previous sprints. Increment needs to be usable without needed any additional work. 

A Product Backlog Item or Increment must meet the "Definition of Done" to be considered complete or done. The Definition of Done must be created by the Scrum Team.
