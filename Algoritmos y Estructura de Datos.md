# Algorithm and Data Structure
## Introduction
**Abstract data type (ADT)** is a mathematical model for data types, where a data yype is defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of view of a user of the data. specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.

**Data structure** is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

**What it's an Algorithm?**

Input - Procedure (steps to transform input to output) - Output

- How much time will our algorithm take for solving a problem?
- How much memory will our algorithm consume for solving a problem?
