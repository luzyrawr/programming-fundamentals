## String Interpolation

Another option of string concatenation, isÂ string interpolation, which substitutes values of variables into placeholders in a string. Note that you do not have to worry about spaces, like with concatenation:

```
string firstName = "John"; 
string lastName = "Doe"; 
string name = $"My full name is: {firstName} {lastName}"; 
Console.WriteLine(name); //Output: My full name is: John Doe
```
