# JavaScript

Strings can be written by enclosing their content in quotes.

```
`Down on the sea`
"Lie on the ocean"
'Float on the ocean'
```

Backtick-quoted strings, usually called template literals. Apart from being able to span lines, they can also embed other values.
```
`half of 100 is ${100 / 2}`
```
When you write something inside ${} in a template literal, its result will be computed, converted to a string, and included at that position. The example produces “half of 100 is 50”.
