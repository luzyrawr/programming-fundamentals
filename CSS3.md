## CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
1. Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
1. Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
1. Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
1. Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
1. Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
